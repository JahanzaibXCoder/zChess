Project intro :

The project is based on a Chess game website, the project is completed only as per the requirements by the Sir Tayyab (Relational database and user management system)

What is working in the project?

1. Login / Register / Logout system with MySQL database as back-end.
2. Registered user stats can be managed / edited by moderators.
3. Player ranking (Required for Chess game, i.e : newbie, medium, expert, professional, master and for management purposes, we have Moderator role).
4. There are 5 Chess modes meaning total 5 lobbies for each chess mode. Every mode is independent from other lobbies and their players.
5. Lobby shows players active in current lobby, players only see players online in their own lobby only.
6. You can play singleplayer chess game, it has all pieces and their moves except the King & Castling.
6.1: There is no AI / Chess API implemented as it wasn't necessary considering the requirements.
6.2: Multiplayer matches aren't a possibility as of yet.
7. Lobby has a shoutbox / chatbox using AJAX method and MySQL. All messages are saved to DB. Each lobby has it's separate chat data.
